## Cooperation Plan

We have strengths that make us do the best. Creativity is the first of our goals.  We have ambition, initiative and take responsibility so that each of us takes the initiative to work to reach the best results. We like to work as one team because we share ideas and help each other. We accept constructive criticism and solve the problems that face us in the right ways without rushing.  We always think about how we can develop in this field to present a great and distinctive work in this project.  For example, time commitment is one of the foundations for successful work.  As long as we have these points, we will definitely provide impressive results in our  project.

We may need to strengthen our self-confidence because we are new to software development. We hope to become professional software developers.  Of course, with the passage of time this problem will be solved, because it is a matter of time and hard work.

We like to work as a team, and there is interaction between us and mutual respect.  We make plans so that we distribute roles between us and everyone starts working on a specific part of this project, and then we discuss and edit mistakes if we need to.  In the beginning, we develop a complete daily work plan with times, and begin to complete the tasks, we help among ourselves so that if one of us does not know a specific idea, we clarify it and work to solve it together.


## Conflict Plan 

In case of any conflict, we go back to the team leader for a solution or to resolve the situation, to reach a common ground for opinions. Also team leader ensure that tasks are distributed efficiently between the members so everyone can contribute and prevent anybody from doing more than he/she is assigned to. On other hand it's okay to help each other with tasks if someone is stuck or facing a problem in completing a task. If a member is not not adequately contributing, the team leader will tell the member of it, asking him/her if they are facing any problem that prevents required contribution. All cases should  be reported to the team leader, but in case of failure in handling it, the team leader will contact the instruction team to report the conflict.

## Communication Plan

In general, team members said they were able to stay in touch until midnight, and there would be two breaks from 4.00 pm - 5.00 pm and a lunch break from 6.30 pm - 8.30 pm.
We created a private group to communicate on slack, and we agreed to meet on 'Zoom' outside the official working hours,In the event that we start to be late at work, we will double our efforts, reduce rest hours, and increase work periods. Everyone's voice will be heard, and in the event of disagreement on a certain point, we will take the opinion of the majority.

## Work Plan

Tasks identified by features, each feature in the project is a task, and each task assigned to one member each time . For assigning tasks to members and tracking the work flow we will use Trello.

## Git Process

All component will be included in live on github.The repository will be shared by adding all team members to the private organization, each person on the team will create its own branches and then push them to the github, and if there are no conflicts, these branches will be merged with the main one. We will use a PR review workflow and all of our members must review a PR but the merge it will be for team leader only, and we merge when all things are working well.
