# As a group, we agreed on three ideas and they are:

## 1- Mode assistant.
an application can detect the person mode, weather angry, sad, happy or surprised; and biased on the mode the app recommends a convenient song for his mode, for example: if someone is angry, a quite song is recommended so the used changes his mode.
## 2- Holiday Greeting
a chatbot app that send messages according to the calendar, this app will be automictically designed to send messages on celebrations events, for example the app can send a birthday quote or can send on Eid holidays sentences like ' Happy Eid'

We also came up with third idea as a backup idea:
## 3- Cars Tracker.
an application that can count number of cars in a street, the point of the application is to collect data on the street, this data can be used to reduce the traffic and recommend other streets that has higher capacity.
